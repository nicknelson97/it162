     <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
    
       <p>My name is Dominick Nelson and I am currently a student at Seattle Central College. I only recently moved to Seattle, and I'm still getting used to living in such a big and busy city. I'm studying for a degree in computer science, although I don't know where I want to go with it yet. </p>
           
      <p>I'm still pretty new to the computer science scene, but I've been having fun and enjoying everything I've been learning so far!</p>

       <h3>What do I like to do?</h3>

       <p>My hobbies include hanging out with my cat, walking around and taking in the Seattle scenery, and playing games with my friends and girlfriend.</p>
