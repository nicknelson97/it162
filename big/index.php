           <h2 class="subheader">Welcome</h2>
           <p>Welcome to my <b>IT 162 BIG project web page!</b> I've created a myriad of pages for my project, to demonstrate my improved web development skills. I've included a  Google Calendar embed, a DOT live web camera embed, and an embedded video about Web Accessability.</p>
           <p>I feel like I've accomplished a lot here already, but I still plan on continuing to expand my skills. Towards that end I plan on taking more web development and CSS classes at school, as well as finding tutorials online to hone my skills and help me develop some solo projects.</p>
